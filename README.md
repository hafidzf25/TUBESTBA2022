# Construct Turing Machine for language L = {0n1n | n≥1}

The language L = {0n1n | n≥1} represents a kind of language where we use only 3 character, i.e., 0, and 1. In the beginning language has some number of 0’s and then followed by equal number of 1’s. Any such string which falls in this category will be accepted by this language. The beginning and end of string is marked by $ sign.
